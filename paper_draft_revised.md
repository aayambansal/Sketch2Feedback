# Sketch2Feedback: Rubric-Aligned Feedback for Student-Drawn STEM Diagrams with Lightweight Multimodal Models

**Anonymous Authors**  
**Paper #XXX**

## Abstract

Large multimodal models (LMMs) show promise for educational feedback, yet most evaluations target text or code rather than student-drawn diagrams that encode conceptual understanding in STEM. We introduce Sketch2Feedback, a rubric-aligned evaluation for free-body and simple circuit diagrams. Contributions: (i) FBD-10 and Circuit-10, two micro-benchmarks with controllable error injection and pixel-level annotations; (ii) a grammar-in-the-loop baseline that detects diagram primitives, builds a symbolic graph, enforces physics/electrical constraints, and elicits concise feedback from a compact VLM; and (iii) an evaluation suite for error detection (F1), localization (IoU), feedback actionability (rubric-based), and hallucinations. We hypothesize and design experiments to test whether enforcing domain constraints reduces hallucination and improves actionability versus end-to-end prompting. We will release anonymized generation code, rubrics, and prompts after review to catalyze reproducible, pedagogy-aligned multimodal feedback research.

## 1. Introduction

Free-body and circuit diagrams are core to learning in physics and introductory EE; they externalize conceptual structure in ways that text alone does not. Timely formative feedback improves learning when it is specific, actionable, and aligned to task goals—but providing such feedback on hand sketches at scale remains difficult [1]. Meanwhile, LMMs (e.g., LLaVA [2]; GPT-4V [3]) can parse images and generate explanations, yet their behavior on student-style diagrams is under-evaluated, and they are prone to hallucinations that undermine trust in classrooms.

We introduce Sketch2Feedback, a lightweight pipeline and evaluation framework for rubric-aligned formative feedback on student-drawn diagrams. Our goal is education-first: measure whether systems identify pedagogically salient errors and propose actionable fixes, not just recognize symbols.

### Contributions

1. **Two micro-benchmarks**: FBD-10 (physics) and Circuit-10 (DC circuits) with controlled error taxonomies, pixel-level boxes/masks, and rubric keys.

2. **Grammar-in-the-loop baseline**: classical detection → symbolic graph → constraint checks (force schema, ground/polarity) → rubric-aligned feedback via a compact VLM.

3. **Evaluation suite**: error detection (macro/micro-F1), localization (IoU), feedback correctness/actionability (Likert), hallucination rate, calibration, and cost/latency.

4. **Open artifacts** (anonymized during review): generation code, rubrics, and prompts for replicability.

## 2. Related Work

### Educational Multimodality & LMMs

Visual instruction tuning powers LMMs like LLaVA [2]; OpenAI's GPT-4V system card [3] documents safety considerations for image inputs—yet neither target rubric-aligned feedback on student drawings. Recent work on efficient VLMs like Idefics2 [4] and MiniCPM-V [5] enables deployment-scale systems, but educational applications remain understudied.

### Diagram Understanding in STEM

**Free-body diagrams**: Mechanix [6] pioneered sketch-based grading for FBDs using sketch recognition with an instructor key; other approaches avoid recognition by constraining input modalities (e.g., structured FBD editors). Our setting instead assumes freehand variation and evaluates feedback quality, not only recognition.

**Circuit diagram analysis**: Recent work frames schematic→graph→netlist extraction with component/line/text detection [7]; public handwritten circuit datasets (e.g., Thoma et al. [8]; Digitize-HCD [9]) enable detection baselines but do not evaluate feedback actionability.

### Benchmarks for Visual Math/Education

Tangram [10] stresses geometric element recognition, revealing LMM limits on seemingly simple spatial tasks—supporting our focus on basic, pedagogy-salient perception errors. However, Tangram focuses on recognition rather than formative feedback generation.

### Educational Feedback Theory

Hattie & Timperley [1] identify four levels of feedback (task, process, self-regulation, self); Shute [11] emphasizes specificity and actionability in formative feedback. These frameworks inform our rubric design and evaluation metrics.

### LLM-as-Judge Considerations

Where we use "LLM-as-judge" to scale rating, we report agreement and mitigate bias (e.g., position bias [12]) per recent findings on judge reliability.

## 3. Tasks & Datasets

### 3.1 Scenarios

**FBD-10**: inclined plane, hanging mass, pushing block, car on road, pendulum, block on table, sliding block, elevator, projectile, spring-mass.

**Circuit-10**: series, parallel, series-parallel, diode polarity, battery-resistor, LED + resistor, voltage divider, current source, capacitor charge/discharge, grounded reference patterns.

### 3.2 Error Taxonomy (Unified Across Tasks)

1. **Missing force/component**: Required element not shown
2. **Wrong direction/orientation**: Incorrect arrow or component orientation
3. **Extra element**: Unnecessary or incorrect element present
4. **Wrong label**: Incorrect labeling of forces or components
5. **Wrong connection**: Incorrect component connections (circuits)
6. **Missing ground**: No ground reference (circuits)
7. **Wrong polarity**: Incorrect battery/diode orientation
8. **Anchoring error**: Vector tail incorrectly positioned

### 3.3 Generation (Synthetic-First, Real-Lite)

**Synthetic generation**: Vector-to-raster renderer with stroke jitter, lighting, whiteboard noise; error injection library yields ground-truth boxes and labels. This approach enables controlled experiments with known error distributions.

**Real-style validation**: 20-40 teacher sketches for a small real-style test set (anonymized, no student data). Public circuit datasets [8,9] can optionally augment realism in ablations.

**Dataset size**: Target ≥200 images per dataset per split (train/test) to enable statistically reliable evaluation with bootstrap confidence intervals.

### 3.4 Rubric Design

We design a two-dimensional rubric following Hattie & Timperley [1] and Shute [11]:

**Correctness** (1-5): Does feedback identify the actual error?
- 1 = Wrong concept/element
- 3 = Names the right error but ambiguous
- 5 = Identifies error and exact locus (e.g., "friction arrow should point up-slope, tail on block-plane contact")

**Actionability** (1-5): Does feedback suggest a fix a novice can follow?
- 1 = Vague ("fix forces")
- 3 = Partial ("add normal force")
- 5 = Specific steps ("draw normal ⊥ plane from contact point; remove duplicate applied force")

See Appendix A for full rubric with examples.

## 4. Methods

### 4.1 Grammar-in-the-Loop Pipeline

Our approach separates perception, reasoning, and generation to reduce hallucinations:

#### Stage 1: Primitive Detection

- **Arrows**: Line segments + arrowhead heuristics via HoughLinesP
- **Wires**: Skeletonization + HoughLinesP for connectivity
- **Symbols**: Template/contour for resistor/diode/battery; HoughCircles for nodes
- **Text**: MSER or OCR as needed for labels

#### Stage 2: Symbolic Graph Construction

Build a typed graph where:
- **Nodes**: Forces, masses, planes (FBD); components, junctions (circuits)
- **Attributes**: Pose, label, orientation
- **Edges**: Connectivity/incidence relationships

#### Stage 3: Constraint Checking

**FBD constraints**:
- Required forces present?
- Directions consistent with schema?
- Vector tails anchored to body/point?

**Circuit constraints**:
- Ground present?
- Diode/battery polarity consistent?
- Graph connected?
- No illegal shorts?
- KCL/KVL sanity on coarse topology

#### Stage 4: Feedback Generation

Use minimal VLM (e.g., Idefics2-8B [4] or MiniCPM-V [5]) only to verbalize violations into rubric-aligned messages, avoiding end-to-end hallucinations from full LMMs.

**Pseudocode**:

```
Input: image x
P ← detect_primitives(x)
G ← build_symbolic_graph(P)
C ← check_constraints(G)           # returns list of (violation, span)
if C = ∅: return "Looks correct. Next step: ..."
S ← map_violations_to_rubric(C)    # structured keys
y ← VLM_generate_feedback(S, fewshot_rubric_prompts)
return y
```

### 4.2 Baseline Models

**B1: End-to-End LMM**: LLaVA-style [2] prompting ("identify & explain errors") without intermediate structure.

**B2: Vision-Only**: Detection + canned feedback (no VLM).

**B3: Ablations**:
- (i) No constraints
- (ii) Constraints only (no VLM)
- (iii) Grammar + VLM without rubric prompts

### 4.3 Efficiency Note

We favor small VLMs (Idefics2-8B [4]; MiniCPM-V variants [5]) to align with classroom deployability constraints (latency, cost, privacy).

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Data & Splits

**Per dataset**: 200 train (for pipeline tuning), 200 test (report only test). Stratify by scenario × error type × noise level.

**Real-style add-on**: 40 teacher sketches (hold-out) to assess synthetic-to-real generalization.

### 5.2 Metrics

#### Detection
- **Macro/micro-F1** by error type
- **Calibration**: Expected Calibration Error (ECE)

#### Localization
- **Mean IoU**
- **IoU@0.5**

#### Feedback Quality
- **Correctness** (1-5): "Identified the true error"
- **Actionability** (1-5): "Gives a concrete fix a novice can follow"
- **Length**: Token count
- **Readability**: Flesch-Kincaid grade level

Anchored in education literature [1,11]: feedback should be specific, task-focused, and actionable.

#### Hallucination
- **Hallucination rate**: Fraction of feedback referring to non-existent elements
- Report with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals

#### Efficiency
- **Latency**: ms/image
- **Cost**: $/1k images

### 5.3 Rating Protocol

**Human raters**: 2 instructors blind to method; Cohen's κ for inter-rater agreement (target κ > 0.6).

**LLM-as-judge** (optional): Prompt-calibrated judge with position-balanced presentations; report agreement with humans and follow best practices to mitigate judge biases [12].

### 5.4 Robustness & Ablations

**Noise buckets**: Neat vs. messy strokes; perspective skew; low-contrast

**Symbol variance**: Resistor as squiggle vs. rectangle; arrowhead styles

**Constraint sensitivity**: Remove each rule and re-measure hallucinations and actionability deltas

### 5.5 Statistical Analysis

- Report **mean ± 95% bootstrap CI** (10,000 resamples)
- **Paired bootstrap** for method comparisons
- **Holm-Bonferroni** correction for multiple comparisons

### 6.2 Preliminary Observations

**FBD performance**: Classical CV shows promise for basic error detection (F1=0.47 on pilot), suggesting domain-specific approaches may complement general-purpose LMMs.

**Circuit challenges**: Both approaches struggled with circuit analysis (F1=0.00), indicating need for improved component detection and electrical constraint checking.

**Feedback quality**: Grammar+VLM showed higher actionability scores (5.0 vs 2.6) when constraints fired, but constraint reliability needs improvement to reduce false positives.

**Hallucination trends**: Vision-only showed lower false positive rates in pilot, but sample size too small for statistical significance.

### 6.3 Full Experimental Results (In Progress)

We are currently running experiments with:
- **n=200 per dataset** for statistical reliability
- **Bootstrap confidence intervals** (95% CI)
- **Multiple random seeds** for robustness
- **Teacher-drawn validation set** (n=40)

Expected completion: [specify timeline for workshop submission]

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Key Insights from Pilot

**Domain-specific approaches matter**: Classical CV combined with domain constraints provides a viable alternative to end-to-end LMMs for structured educational tasks.

**Constraint quality is critical**: High actionability scores when constraints fire correctly, but false positives undermine trust. Future work should focus on improving constraint robustness.

**Circuit analysis requires deeper electrical knowledge**: Both approaches struggled with circuits, suggesting need for more sophisticated electrical engineering reasoning (e.g., SPICE-like analysis).

### 7.2 Limitations

**Synthetic datasets**: Current evaluation limited to programmatically generated diagrams. Real student drawings present additional challenges (handwriting variations, incomplete sketches, ambiguous symbols).

**Small pilot sample**: n=5 insufficient for statistical claims; full experiments (n=200) in progress.

**Simplified error taxonomy**: Focus on 8 common error types. Real student errors may be more complex and nuanced (e.g., conceptual misunderstandings reflected in diagram structure).

**Limited model comparison**: Pilot tests 2 approaches. Full study will include end-to-end LMM baseline (LLaVA-style) and additional ablations.

**Constraint engineering**: Hand-crafted constraints may miss edge cases. Future work should explore learned constraints from annotated student data.

### 7.3 Validity & Generalization

**Synthetic-to-real gap**: Explicitly measuring generalization to teacher-drawn sketches (n=40). Release generator to enable community testing on diverse drawing styles.

**Rubric validation**: Co-designed with 2 physics/EE instructors; future work should validate with larger instructor panels and student perception studies.

**Pedagogical effectiveness**: Current evaluation measures technical correctness and actionability; actual learning gains require classroom deployment studies.

## 8. Ethics & Responsible Use

**Privacy**: Synthetic + teacher-authored only; no student PII. Any future student data collection will follow IRB protocols.

**Validity threats**: Synthetic-to-real gap explicitly acknowledged and measured via teacher sketch validation.

**LLM-as-judge caution**: Where used, we report human-judge agreement and implement judge-bias controls [12].

**Deployment considerations**: Systems must be validated with instructors before classroom use; feedback should augment, not replace, human instruction.

**Accessibility**: Grammar-in-the-loop approach enables offline/privacy-preserving deployment on commodity hardware.

## 9. Conclusion & Future Work

We introduced Sketch2Feedback, a rubric-aligned evaluation framework for automated feedback on student-drawn STEM diagrams. Our grammar-in-the-loop approach separates perception, reasoning, and generation to reduce hallucinations while maintaining actionability.

Pilot results suggest that domain-specific approaches can complement end-to-end LMMs for structured educational tasks, but constraint quality is critical for practical deployment. Full experimental results (n=200 per dataset) will provide statistical validation of these trends.

### Future Directions

1. **Real student data**: Collect and annotate actual student drawings to validate synthetic results
2. **Improved constraints**: Learn constraints from annotated data or integrate physics/circuit simulators
3. **Multi-modal fusion**: Combine vision, language, and symbolic reasoning more effectively
4. **Pedagogical validation**: Conduct classroom studies to assess learning gains
5. **Expanded domains**: Extend to other diagram types (chemical structures, biological pathways)

Our contributions—micro-benchmarks, grammar-in-the-loop baseline, and comprehensive evaluation suite—provide a foundation for future research in educational multimodal systems.
