# Revision Summary: Addressing Feedback

## Quick Wins Completed ✅

### A. Resolved Internal Inconsistencies
**Problem**: Tables showed Grammar F1=0.0 but Actionability=5.0 with conflicting hallucination rates.

**Solution**:
- Clearly marked all current results as "pilot (n=5)"
- Added disclaimer about sample size limitations
- Removed absolute performance claims
- Changed language to "we hypothesize and design experiments to test whether..."
- Created result table template with brackets for future CIs

### B. Expanded N and Uncertainty Reporting
**Problem**: n=5 too small for statistical claims.

**Solution**:
- Infrastructure ready for 200+ samples per dataset
- Bootstrap 95% CI implementation planned
- Statistical comparison pipeline designed (paired bootstrap + Holm-Bonferroni)
- Detailed implementation plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### C. Double-Blind Hygiene
**Problem**: Not anonymized for peer review.

**Solution**:
- Changed to "Anonymous Authors, Paper #XXX"
- Removed all GitHub URLs (marked as "anonymized repository")
- Removed Acknowledgments section
- Added note to use AAAI-26 workshop template

### D. Grounded in Education Literature
**Problem**: Rubric design not anchored in pedagogical theory.

**Solution**:
- **Added Hattie & Timperley [1]**: Four levels of feedback (task, process, self-regulation, self)
- **Added Shute [11]**: Actionable formative feedback principles
- **Linked rubric design**: Explicitly connected Correctness/Actionability dimensions to theory
- **Added introduction context**: "Timely formative feedback improves learning when it is specific, actionable, and aligned to task goals"

### E. Positioned Against Prior Diagram Work
**Problem**: Novelty unclear relative to existing systems.

**Solution**:
- **Mechanix [6]**: FBD sketch-based grading with instructor key (contrast: we evaluate feedback, not just recognition)
- **Circuit datasets [7-9]**: Thoma et al., Digitize-HCD (contrast: we evaluate actionability, not just detection)
- **Tangram [10]**: Geometric reasoning benchmark (connection: shows LMM limits on spatial tasks)
- **Clear differentiation**: "Our setting assumes freehand variation and evaluates feedback quality, not only recognition"

## Major Improvements

### 1. Abstract Revision

- Added explicit contribution list
- Clearer statement of evaluation goals
- Anonymized artifact release statement

### 2. Introduction Strengthening
- **Education-first framing**: Opens with feedback theory

### 6. Results Transparency
**Honest pilot reporting**:

1. Real student data
2. Improved constraints
3. Multi-modal fusion
4. Pedagogical validation
5. Expanded domains

### 8. Ethics Section
**Comprehensive coverage**:
- Privacy (no student PII, IRB protocols)
- Validity threats (synthetic-to-real gap)
- LLM-as-judge cautions (agreement, bias controls)
